So I did it...I gave my two weeks' notice...hard to believe it,  but I'll be back in Lancaster before you know it, then back in Bloomington for May/June...not sure what after that.

What's a really good album released in the last year or two?  Need something good to listen to while I plot my future.

Someone keeps driving through the parking lot of our apartment complex, and sounding 7 short honks as they speed away.  It's been happening several times a day for almost a week now.  Is this some kind of drug thing?  If so, obvious much?  If not, then wtf?

"I'm gonna change my name to Yolanda and forget about tomorrow" || Have you ever referenced an inside joke mentally, only to realize that the person you had the joke with is dead, so now it's actually a joke with no one?  That's how I feel right now.  I just called in sick to work after a sleepless, vaguely soul-searching night, and I thought: "Ha.  I don't care about calling in to work.  None of it matters.  I'm gonna change my name to Yolanda and forget about tomorrow."  This was an inside joke with Elizabeth.  No sooner had I inwardly smirked, when I realized she is gone and I'm alone in my head 2000 miles away.

Chris is 30, holy crap!  It was kind of a sad and uneventful day.  I've been too busy between constant working and constant dentist visits (they keep fucking up) to prepare anything.  We failed to find anything to do, then fell asleep at home at dinner time.
